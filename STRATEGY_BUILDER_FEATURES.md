# Strategy Builder - Enhanced Features

## Overview

The strategy builder has been completely revamped to include advanced entry conditions (position sizing) and comprehensive risk management with stop loss and take profit options.

## New Features

### 1. Entry Conditions (Position Sizing)

The new entry conditions section allows traders to define how much capital to allocate to each trade:

#### Position Sizing Types:

- **Fixed Percentage**: Use a fixed percentage of portfolio per trade (e.g., 2%)
- **Fixed Dollar Amount**: Use a fixed dollar amount per trade (e.g., $1000)
- **Risk-Based Sizing**: Risk a specific percentage of portfolio per trade (e.g., 1% risk)
- **Kelly Criterion**: Dynamic sizing based on win rate and odds
- **Volatility-Based**: Adjust position size based on market volatility

#### Features:

- Preset configurations for common strategies
- Custom configuration options
- Maximum position size limits
- Risk per trade controls
- Volatility period settings

### 2. Risk Management (Stop Loss & Take Profit)

#### Stop Loss Options:

- **Fixed Percentage**: Stop loss at specific percentage (e.g., 5%)
- **Fixed Dollar Amount**: Stop loss at specific dollar amount
- **Trailing Percentage**: Dynamic trailing stop loss with activation threshold
- **ATR-Based**: Stop loss based on Average True Range multiplier
- **Support/Resistance**: Stop loss at specific price levels

#### Take Profit Options:

- **Fixed Percentage**: Take profit at specific percentage (e.g., 10%)
- **Fixed Dollar Amount**: Take profit at specific dollar amount
- **Risk:Reward Ratio**: Take profit based on risk:reward ratio (e.g., 1:2)
- **Indicator-Based**: Exit based on technical indicator conditions

#### Advanced Features:

- Tabbed interface for easy navigation between stop loss and take profit
- Preset configurations for common strategies
- Custom configuration with detailed parameters
- Real-time display of current risk management settings
- Support for multiple exit conditions simultaneously

### 3. User Interface Improvements

#### Modern Design:

- Clean, card-based layout
- Responsive grid system
- Interactive preset buttons
- Collapsible custom configuration sections
- Tabbed navigation for risk management

#### User Experience:

- Intuitive preset selection
- Clear visual feedback for selected options
- Comprehensive current strategy display
- Easy switching between different configurations
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components:

- `EntryConditionSelector`: Handles position sizing configuration
- `ExitConditionSelector`: Manages stop loss and take profit settings
- `StrategyBuilder`: Main component integrating all sections
- Enhanced type definitions for better TypeScript support

### State Management:

- Zustand store updated to handle new entry and risk management conditions
- Proper state persistence and loading
- Validation and error handling

### Data Structure:

```typescript
interface StrategyConfiguration {
  conditions: Condition[];
  logicalOperator: "AND" | "OR";
  action: "LONG" | "SHORT";
  entryCondition: EntryCondition;
  exitCondition: ExitCondition;
}

interface EntryCondition {
  positionSizing: PositionSizingType;
  sizingValue: number;
  maxPositionSize?: number;
  riskPerTrade?: number;
  volatilityPeriod?: number;
}

interface ExitCondition {
  stopLoss: StopLossConfig;
  takeProfit: TakeProfitConfig;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Conservative Strategy

- **Entry**: 2% portfolio per trade, max 10% position
- **Stop Loss**: 5% fixed percentage
- **Take Profit**: 1:2 risk:reward ratio

### Example 2: Aggressive Strategy

- **Entry**: 5% portfolio per trade, max 20% position
- **Stop Loss**: 2x ATR-based stop
- **Take Profit**: 10% fixed percentage

### Example 3: Risk-Managed Strategy

- **Entry**: 1% risk per trade, Kelly Criterion sizing
- **Stop Loss**: 10% trailing stop (activates at 5% profit)
- **Take Profit**: RSI > 70 exit condition

## Benefits

1. **Professional Risk Management**: Advanced position sizing and stop loss options
2. **Flexibility**: Multiple risk management strategies and entry conditions
3. **User-Friendly**: Preset configurations and intuitive interface
4. **Comprehensive**: Covers all major trading strategy requirements
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new position sizing and risk management types

## Future Enhancements

- Portfolio correlation analysis
- Advanced risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- Backtesting integration with new conditions
- Strategy performance analytics
- Risk-adjusted position sizing algorithms
