# Deployment Fixes for Vercel

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve 404 errors and routing issues when deploying the React app to Vercel.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client-Side Routing (404 Errors on Refresh/Direct Navigation)

**Problem**: When users refresh the page or navigate directly to a route (e.g., `/dashboard`), Vercel returns a 404 error because it's looking for a file at that path instead of serving the React app's `index.html`.

**Solution**: Added `vercel.json` configuration with rewrite rules to serve `index.html` for all routes.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Logout Button White Screen Issues

**Problem**: The logout function was causing white screens because the App component wasn't reactive to authentication state changes. The component was checking `localStorage.getItem('accessToken')` at render time but not re-rendering when tokens were cleared.

**Solution**: 
- Created an `AuthContext` to properly manage authentication state
- Made the App component reactive to auth state changes
- Updated all components to use the centralized auth context instead of directly accessing localStorage
- This ensures proper state management and prevents white screens after logout

### 3. Inconsistent Navigation Methods

**Problem**: Different components were using different navigation methods (`window.location`, `window.location.reload()`, etc.) which caused inconsistent behavior.

**Solution**:

- Created a centralized navigation utility (`src/utils/navigation.ts`)
- Updated all React components to use `useNavigate()` hook
- Updated API interceptors to use the navigation utility

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files

- `vercel.json` - Added client-side routing configuration

### Context Files

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Created authentication context for state management

### Utility Files

- `src/utils/navigation.ts` - Created navigation utility for non-React contexts

### Component Files

- `src/components/common/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Fixed logout navigation
- `src/components/homepage/LoginForm.tsx` - Fixed login success navigation
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` - Fixed authentication error navigation
- `src/components/builder/StrategyBuilder.tsx` - Fixed authentication error navigation

### API Files

- `src/api.ts` - Updated interceptors to use navigation utility

## How the Fixes Work

1. **Vercel Configuration**: The `vercel.json` file tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

2. **Authentication Context**: The `AuthContext` provides centralized state management for authentication, ensuring the App component re-renders when auth state changes.

3. **React Router Navigation**: Using `navigate()` instead of `window.location` ensures that navigation happens within React Router's context, preventing routing conflicts.

4. **Centralized Navigation**: The navigation utility provides consistent behavior across both React and non-React contexts (like API interceptors).

## Testing the Fixes

After deploying these changes:

1. **Refresh Test**: Navigate to `/dashboard` and refresh the page - should work without 404 errors
2. **Direct Navigation**: Type `/dashboard` directly in the URL bar - should work without 404 errors
3. **Logout Test**: Click the logout button - should navigate to home page without errors
4. **Authentication Errors**: Any 401 errors should properly redirect to the home page

## Deployment Notes

- These changes are specifically for Vercel deployment
- The `vercel.json` file should be in the root of your frontend directory
- Make sure to rebuild and redeploy after making these changes
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with local development
