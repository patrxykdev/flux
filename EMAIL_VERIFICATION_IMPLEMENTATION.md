## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

```sql
-- New tables created
CREATE TABLE api_userprofile (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER UNIQUE REFERENCES auth_user(id),
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    email_verification_sent_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);

CREATE TABLE api_emailverification (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES auth_user(id),
    token UUID UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Signal Handlers

- Automatic UserProfile creation when User is created
- Ensures all users have profiles

### Email Configuration

- **Service**: Resend (resend.com)
- **API Key**: Configured via environment variable
- **From Address**: FluxTrader <noreply@fluxtrader.xyz>

## Usage Flow

2. 5-minute cooldown prevents spam
3. New token is generated and sent
